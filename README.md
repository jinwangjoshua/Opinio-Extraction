# Opinio-Extraction

This is the explanation for all the files in this repo.

- reviews folder: folder contains all original reviews data of nine products.
- results folder: folders contain all clustered data and visualization data for each model.
  - word2vec folder: visualizations and cluster opinions results using word2vec
  - glove folder: visualizations and cluster opinions results using glove
  - accuracies.csv: accuracy for each opinions results, how to get the accuracy numbers
- phrases.csv: the opinions after preprocessing and opinion extraction.
- work_proflio.ipynb: the work flow and explanation for all the work. I confirm this jupyter notebook is runable. The preprocessing part will cost **mins.** and the semantic clustering partr will cost around 30 hours.(Intel i7, 16GB memory, Ubuntu 16.04). For the semantic distance calculating part, the total running time for all the products for all the models are over 30 hours. So in this profolio, we make a presentation of one product.
