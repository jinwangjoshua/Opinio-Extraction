Wildcat Willie,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFM2F26OBZMRD5765Y2L6CAZTFIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"A great coffee making machine. This is the latest Keurig we have bought and enjoyed. My wife is a coffee devotee and she deserves really good coffee and so I have made sure that we always have a working Keurig with good K-cups. All the machines we have owned make great coffee and all of them have little nitpicky problems. We don't remove our water reservoir to fill it, but get water from the refrigerator dispenser so it is filtered. Doing that means we to have to pour in water through the lid and this new machine makes that very easy because it is hinged and stays open by itself. This means I no longer have to remove the entire lid. The reservoir is also much larger so it lasts a lot longer between fillings. The display is large and gives clear information about the brewing process and is very easy to modify to your own brewing style and tastes. Very nice functionality of the electronics and settings. The brew process starts very quickly once a selection is made and dispenses quickly and well. The unit we bought has functioned almost flawlessly for about two months now and we are very pleased. Now for the nitpicking... The needle can clog a little more easily than our old unit; while making non-ground coffee drinks like the Caf  Escapes powder drinks it not-infrequently stops up and requires a little attention. Even so, the new interface makes this easier to address too; it notifies you that you have to raise the lever and remove the k-cup instead of just stopping dispensing. The grate that the cups sit on is both handy and problematic. Handy in that it is easily removed and therefore allows you to use taller cups, problematic in that it doesn't stay snapped in place firmly and so I am always pushing it back in place. The biggest quibble for me were the instructions that came with it for one simple reason and that is it said to run one cup of clear water through before starting to brew your coffee. I say forget that and run a whole reservoir though it first. I ran a couple of cups first and it still tasted slightly metallic and chemical so I dumped it out and ran a bunch more water through before brewing my coffee. The bottom line for me is that coffee costs a ton more than it did a few years ago, but coffee in our kitchen is a pleasure to drink and very consistent in brew characteristics.",Top of the Line brewer,338,2017-01-20 00:00:00,5.0,True,Keurig K575 Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker with 12oz Brew Size,https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-K575-Strength-Programmable-Platinum/dp/B018UQ5VEK/ref=sr_1_3?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1536938460&sr=1-3&keywords=keurig+coffee+maker

We've had it a year and would not buy it again when it dies. We bought our first Keurig several years ago and wore it out and then wore out a second one. We bought this one to replace that second one and have never liked it as much. It takes longer to brew a cup of coffee. It's noisier. It requires considerable more maintenance. Coffee pod explosions in the machine are a frequent occurrence. See photos. Would I recommend this machine? Not on a bet.

Members of our household all leave at different times in the morning so it is great to have a fresh cup, instead of stale leftovers from the earliest riser. I had to measure how much liquid my different mugs held so I would know what size to choose. We bought the refillable pods (a set of 5) and they do a great job and save me quite a bit of money. And this way we can each have a cup of our own favorite coffee. It comes with extra filters and an easy to understand manual. We got the carafe for when we need a potful quickly. It makes coffee as fast as our Bunn coffeemaker, which is very fast indeed. Beware of overfilling a reusable pod, you'll get some spillage when making a cup. The touch screen is very intuitive and easy to operate. I like that it has an eco-mode where it goes off while not being used; and you can set the amount of time it stays on when you use it. It still heats up rapidly when ""waking up"". The whole lid of the water holder comes off or you can raise a little lid on it. The lid opening is big enough so that you don't spill when filling it.

Unfortunately, both of them smelled strongly of plastic. I washed everything and used vinegar to help get rid of the smell, but even after running an entire tank of of water through (12 oz at a time), the plastic smell and taste just getting stronger. It was like the hot water just brought it out even more. It was very alarming, and made me concerned that there were chemicals leeching into the water. Also, the lever to open and close the machine kept catching and would get stuck, so it wouldn't open. Additionally, while closing the lever with no pod in it, it would often display the brewing display instead of the hot water dispensing display. There seemed to be a glitch. Lastly, while brewing the cocoa pods, it made a very loud and alarming whirring sound.

Stuna,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG2SDLOPGPWLS7OOLCOSVYILVGDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"So BOTH my kcup 2.0 machines died, one was the home unit, one was a travel unit, so bought this figuring that this latest model would be a step up from previous models. Good news, it wakes up, does what it needs to, make a great hot cup of coffee. No need to put water thru it to get oils and crap out, it just worked and taste great (so far, only done like 20-30 cups thru it so far....) Bad news, it takes longer than any previous units I've had to brew a single cup. Between cups, much longer. I have not used a timer, but I'd say this thing takes like 25-50% more time to brew a cup... I can live with that, but I often do a second cup right then (I have big coffee mugs) and this thing take like 2 minutes to cycle to get ready for cup 2. And better yet, you load the second kcup in, it doesn't recognize it when water is ready, so you have to cycle the kcup holder for it to brew - my last one would recognize that a new cup had been placed in there and would start blinking the ""start"" button *and that one took like 15-30 seconds to get ready for cup 2). I would give my old unit 4.5 stars, but it died. If you've used an older 2.0 and go this this and expect quick multiple cups, you may be inclined to rate this at a 2 star due to delays (the idea here is to be fast, right?

Well, the Keurig quit working with distilled water if using the carafe - it works fine with single pods. I changed my rating to 1 star simply because Keurig seems to be utilizing technology to make sure you buy their products ONLY and you have to use other than distilled water. Why? Apparently so they can force you to buy more of their products. Since you cannot use distilled water, the device will need descaling. One of the main reasons for me to use the more expensive is reduced maintenance with good coffee. The Keurig  brews good coffee but a lot of other makers to do.

Since this coffe maker went over the coffee maker rainbow bridge, I ordered this one. After trying to get the thing to work for 30 minutes to no avail, it didn't recognize that the water tank was full, and asked for more water, I called Keurig customer service. The representative was friendly enough, and we went to about 5 gallon of filtered water, filling and emptying the tank, yet the machine still didn't recognize that the tank was filled to the hilt. Upon recommendation I used tap water instead of filtered water for the last round of troubleshooting, but obviously the machine doesn't recognize water containing contaminants such as chlorine either. The final solution is that Keurig will send me a replacement coffee maker within 3-7 business days, and I only have to send the brew head back, as proof that the just purchased, and not functioning machine is actually not in use. That step I find somewhat ironic, as the machine never worked in the first place. 3-7 business days for the delivery of the replacement coffee maker is an eternity for a coffee addict like me.

I currently have only one complaint. I doesn't brew the coffee hot enough. I frequently will toss my cup into the microwave to to zap it for an additional 30 seconds to get it to the proper temperature. I specially purchased this Keurig because it allowed for heat adjustment - so this is a disappointment. However, running on the highest setting it still falls short.

By poking through the various screens and seeing what it does if you do THIS. Oh wow--maybe if I try THAT. I've been running online searches and reading other owners' answers. It's fairly simple if you use k-cups. And despite my qualms about the k-cups I had left over from my old 1.0 K60/ K65 machine I bought 4 years ago, all the ones I still have are apparently ""Keurig approved"", so they won't go to waste. But where I ran into a wall was when I tried to use the MyCup reusable filter with my favorite ground roast. Which is how I do it when I want a simple cup of joe. I loaded the MyCup filter and put it in once the preheat cycle was done and was confronted by a menu of 6 different brewing levels. I tried number 4 as a ""middlin' brew"" and got only 5 ounces of coffee (teacup-size) in my 10-ounce mug. No chance to set the portion size before it started brewing. I googled a question about it and found that a lot of other people ran into that. Some of their solutions included picking the machine apart to clean the ""needles"". I said; ""Not on your life, Jack, with this beast only a couple of days out of the box."" So I took a deep breath and selected the last option--number 6. I got my size selection menu where I could choose 10 ounces and that's what ended up in my cup. ""Eureka"", as the old saying goes. Or maybe nowadays it's ""Dyson"" or ""Shark"". Now if I'd gotten a manual with this gizmo, maybe it would have given me more info about that menu than just non-explanatory numbers for the levels. Well, maybe this one will last longer than the slightly over 4 years the old machine gave me. One thing I'm hoping was what brought on the early demise of the old machine was leaving it on all day in ""demand"" mode. I'm going to stop that with this new one, even if it does mean the ""preheat"" cycle will make it take longer to do each additional cup for lunch, midafternoon and dinner.

There are three things that I find annoying: 1) you cannot set the auto-brew for the carafe without having it pre-heat the water first. So you a) have to wait when you are just trying to quickly set it up before going to bed, and b) it seems wasteful. 2) It also immediately starts reheating again after finishing a cup, also wasteful - if you wanted to do two cups you d be waiting for the first to brew anyway and could easily just push the button again - so I think it s unnecessary 3) it always wants to maintain quite a high level of water. So after a brew, even if you put in the minimum, it still has about 50% left.

Bought this new one in March 2017, did not even start using it until April. I mostly wanted the larger reservoir and auto power options.  By May 15, about two months into use, the unit had failed.  It always was noisey and sounded like it was straining - from the very first brew (by the way took much loner to brew than my old machine).  Then within a couple of weeks It started with incomplete brews and starting making even stranger noises. I cleaned the needle per instructions.  Then it started rejecting about every 2nd or 3rd pod, basically increasing my coffee costs by almost 2 fold (please note this was using Keurig pods, and then a variety of other pods, all of which worked fine in my old Keurig machine, none of which work consistently in the new one).

Bart,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH64HOSODJASHJVNJVV4CYJ5CNPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"Okay, so first off if you are super worried about the fact that this thing has an optical reader and won't brew non-keurig approved kcups. You probably shouldn't be that worried. I was at first. As a matter of fact I was looking into a way to disable the reader. But be warned, if you are planning to attempt a hack by snipping the green and yellow wire. That is no longer possible. All the wires are black now, all of them, also I believe the optical sensor is now digital instead of analog. By that I mean, there is no longer a green or yellow wire to snip. The j27 slot where the green/yellow wires would plug into, are no longer being used in this model. This version of this model was specifically designed to prevent people from hacking it. That being said, once I gave up on the idea of hacking it, I tried all the kcups I had in my cupboard, and guess what, they all worked! Apparently, the optical sensor was a big issue 2 years ago, when most companies hadn't gotten on board with the keurig 2.0 labels yet. But in that time, most of them have. I could not find a single kcup in my cupboard, that wasnt compatible. And I mainly used kroger generic cups, which I assumed wouldn't work, but they did. Now obviously there are still some kcups out there that are super cheap, but they are probably super cheap because they are being phased out and need to be sold quick. But you can easily check the side of any kcup box and it will let you know. Also, I found out the main reason for the optical sensor wasn't to stop you from using them, but apparently the lids tell the keurig what type of pod it is, and the proper way to brew it. That way you don't have to manually enter anything. Regardless if you are brewing tea or coco, or a carafe or a pre-sweetened latte type drink, it automatically knows. It's actually a really cool idea. But I still think they should have given you an option for manually brewing non-labeled kcups. But I think they felt if they allowed it, a lot of kcup manufacturers would not have updated their lids.

Being an engineering Tech I probably should have fixed the old one instead of purchasing the new one. I like a cup of old grey in the morning and have three of four cases left of ""Celestial perfect Iced tea"" that I had purchased in 2013. If I fix the old machine I will send the new one back since I cannot get it to work with the older cups. Also we unplug all kitchen appliances after use, especially the Keurig machine since it has been responsible for house and office fires.  (Not sure which models are most at risk). In 2014 Keurig Recalled 6.6 Million K10 Mini's because of 90 burn complaints. When you unplug the new unit it loses its settings. The old B70 would keep it's brew settings after being unplugged. The new K575 has to be reprogrammed every time we plug it in. Keurig made $4.5 Billion in 2015. How greedy can you get not allowing third party Mom and Pop operations make K cups? The price of the unit was $135 which is a lot cheaper then the old B70 at the time. The Keurig K575 is the ink jet printer and the K-Cups are the ink cartridges. Keurig makes money on the K Cups not the machine.

Both were excellent and brewed good/very good cups of coffee.  However, something has changed with Keurig's manufacturing process.  From the beginning, even after cleaning and running several reservoirs of water through the my new machine, there was a constant ""plastic"" odor to the brewed coffee which also affected taste.  It wasn't just me who noticed this problem.  Unsolicited , other individuals commented upon there sense that something didn't smell or taste right.  No matter what steps were taken to ""clean"" the machine, the odor returned and permeated both the smell and taste of the coffee.  I can only assume that Keurig has changed its production specifications and quality control.  If you research the issue online, you will see that many people have experienced the same problem.  Regardless of price, this issue is completely unacceptable and likely a health concern.

It should not have been marketed or offered for sale. About 75% of the time the carafe feature results in an error message and does not produce a pot of coffee. I called customer service...they told me to perform the ""bulb"" of water maintenance procedure (a pod with a bulb that you add water to and then pump the handle up and down 5 times supposedly clears out a clogged needle). I did that, and the carafe worked the next time...but failed again the second time. I think the problem is the design of the carafe pods, which pokes TWO holes in the top of the pod. Yes, customer service gave me a coupon for 8 free carafe edpods, but what good is that when the technology doesn't work? So I'm stuck using this with only the individual pods. UPDATE: Called Customer Service again...talked at length with a woman who was EMPHATIC that the carafe pods should have a hole punctured in the BOTTOM in addition to the two holes in the top. I argued at length with her that a hole in bottom was mechanically impossible with this unit...but she told me, ""Sir, I've been with the company since it started and I know what I'm talking about."" I asked to speak to her supervisor, who immediately told me there was NO HOLE punctured in the bottom. What a nightmare this whole product/experience has been. The supervisor blames the poor success rate on a bad batch of pods...there are sending me 2 free boxes. We'll see what happens. UPDATE: got boxes direct from Keurig, first carafe pod resulted in ERROR message and incomplete pot of coffee. I'm batting 50% success rate with carafe pods. This unit is either a lemon or the technology is not perfected.UPDATE one month later: called to complain again and was almost sent a new unit, but the man asked what kind of water I used...told him I had Culligan water softener water (which a previous Customer Service rep had said was OK). He said it was NOT OK...neither is distilled water. It MUST be ""spring"" water, otherwise the water ""expands"" the filter in the pod and causes problems. So I dumped the filtered water and ran several cycles of hot water to clean out any old water... used my unfiltered well water... and got TWO full carafes to run correctly.

My son, who served in the Marine Corps and is now a firefighter has had his share of (strong) coffee and when he told me had loved his Keurig, it raised an eyebrow. Finally when my old coffee maker starting to fail, I decided it was time.  I really must say, this machine is pretty great! The K-cups and K-carafe pods are expensive (in my book), but super convenient. I'm somewhat of a cheapskate, so I bought the large and small K pods so I could use my own coffee (I still had a whole bag). It has taken some trial and error to get it all just right, but I love my coffee and that's the bottom line. I use the K-cups for a quick cup in the evening, but use the large pod with my own coffee in the morning to make a whole pot of strong coffee - just the way I like it! Even my wife, who does not drink coffee, enjoys the chai tea k-cups.

Barnacle Bill The Sailor,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHVCNN2R2KTRSTNOUPHGFM2ZSIFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"Our 11 year old Keurig home brewer wasn't dead but it was dying.  No complaints, that coffee maker saw plenty of use.  So I just purchased this top of the current Keurig home line without much thought.  They have come a long way in the past decade.  But it still performs the same basic function of turning out a good cup of coffee quickly.  And still looks basically the same.  The different brew sizes are something I've wanted for years.  An increased reservoir from 60 to 80 oz of water is welcome.  And the touchscreen is well implemented with easy to use customizing options.  It's also both quieter than the old pump system and the noise it does make is different, less annoying.  Also, Keurig has added a water filter to the reservoir and provided a tool to clean the needle that punctures the K-cups.  The machine also reminds you to descale (clean) it periodically.  So it looks like Keurig has put some thought into maintenance and longevity which is appreciated.  And the coffee?  Great as always.  We don't use the disposable K-cups generally.  It's far cheaper to use the reusable K-cups and your favorite coffee.  You'll break even on the price of the reusable K-cups in a single week.",A new replacement for our 11 year old Keurig with a lot of welcome improvements.,,2017-08-10 00:00:00,5.0,True,Keurig K575 Single Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker with 12oz Brew Size,https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-K575-Strength-Programmable-Platinum/dp/B018UQ5VEK/ref=sr_1_3?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1536938460&sr=1-3&keywords=keurig+coffee+maker

Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and what is the one thing you want on a long holiday weekend when it's only 12  out?  Yup... Coffee from our just delivered K575 bought with Christmas money.  My usually non-coffee drinking husband had the idea to get one.  I had been wanting one for years.  Imagine our excitement.  I set it up AFTER fully reading the instructions.  Ran the 1st water only 8oz. cup through.  Then I settled in to relax for the day with a 10oz. cup of one of the samplers included in the box.  Brilliant!  Worked great!  A bit later I realized I had forgotten to discard the empty pod.  I threw it out, lowered the lever and cooked dinner; oblivious that the error message came on.  ""Water pressure....Use maintenance assembly...clean needles..."".  Ran through all that using the instruction manual.  Nothing.  It won't even clear the message so you can run a water cycle through.  Hit the YouTube videos.  Nothing.  Have you ever called support during the holiday?  Don't bother.  They are closed.  It looks like mine lasted 1 cup.  I intend to call them tomorrow and probably exchange this one in hopes that a second one is part of the excellent 5 star batch.

The time savings is a silly argument.  Unless you keep it on all the time you are still only saving a couple minutes from brewing a pot in a normal coffee maker.  The coffee budget quadrupled between all the prepackaged pods and filling the custom ones.  If you try to fill your own pod you wind up using more coffee grinds since the grind can't be too fine otherwise you get sediment in your cup.

justin,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7QTMT5FXGSP5HJVJMCDI5TY2UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,We love keurigs but this most recent design is flawed. A bunch of our name brand coffee that Keurig sells didn't even work in this machine. This Keurig is also far louder than both of our older models were and slower. Thankfully we found solo clip 2.0 to use with this Keurig so we could use the many boxes of k cups we had already purchased. I don't appreciate Keurig trying to screw over their customers by making us unable to use coffee we had already purchased. I wrote Keurig about the issue since there was a sheet inside the new Keurig box that said they would replace any k cups you had that did not work. They replied with a generic email twice and never replaced anything. Very disappointed in them.,Serious downgrade!

I followed all the setup instructions and finally brewed my first cup of coffee. It was, as expected, great. Yesterday morning, my wife and I are looking forward to cup so I brew two cups. I brewed her cup first, mine immediately after. Her cup tasted great, mine tasted so chemical/plastic tasting it was overwhelming. This morning, I try it again. I brew mine first and hers second. Mine tastes great, hers is the plastic/chemical issue. I let the coffee maker cool and brew just two cups of water back to back. I call my wife in and let her just smell the water.

Called keurig in October and they walked me through the same procedure again. worked for about ten cups, then quit working again with the same message. once again I followed the directions for fixing the problem, and again it lasted about 2 days.

Spot on!. Ok, had to say that first, because there was a single issue that I have experienced with this machine, but it does not in my opinion diminish the experience I am having. When I first turned on the machine, there was a pixelated bar across the touchscreen that distorted the graphics and text. It made it hard to read. Now I work in an industry that manufactures industrial networking devices and I am very aware that these kinds of things happen from time to time in the real world. I simply went to my Amazon order history and chose to return the product as defective and to request a replacement. Amazon shipped out another unit the same day and I gave me 30 days to return the original product. They even arranged for shipping. As I said, this does not reflect poorly on the device in my opinion since it could have happened from being mishandled as well as any other occurrence. Amazon's method of handling this issue has more than made up for any inconvenience of having to wait 2 more days to enjoy this Coffee Maker. Kudos Amazon for brilliant customer service.

Ian D Ghrist,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGOA5LQFLKQ6VWWKOW2AKZYJFDUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"I bought this for a 4-person office. We do not have a sink in the office. We have to use the community sink down the hall, so I wanted a simple coffee maker that we could use by filling it with bottled water. Going with the Keurig 2.0 was a disaster. It stopped working after brewing about 5 cups of coffee. It just displayed an error message saying something about there being a problem with the water pressure. I called Keurig tech support and I was told that this model has higher maintenance requirements than the regular model and you have to use the enclosed maintenance kit on the unit once a week. The support person walked me through the process of using the kit, which requires multiple hot water pours (highly inconvenient given that I have to walk all the way down the hall to the community sink to dump the water and the whole point of buying a Keurig machine instead of a regular coffee maker was to avoid this). After performing the maintenance, the machine worked fine. I also found out that the Keurig 2.0 reads your K-Cups and gives you an error message if you try to use a non-Keurig cup, which also forces you to go through the maintenance steps to get the machine working again. I do not think I could possibly be less happy with this piece of junk. I hope I can get a refund and go back to the Keurig 1.0, which worked fine for me in my old office for several years without problems. Buy the 2.0 models at your own risk. They break a lot, require constant maintenance, and are designed to break when non-Keurig cups are used. If you buy one, then get ready to either spend a lot of time on the phone with Keurig's tech support or spend a lot of time reading the manual to figure out how to fix it when it breaks.",the machine worked fine.

It doesn't fool around with electronic wizardry, and will accept off brand coffee pods unlike the newer models. It's also tall enough to accept a travel mug, if you lift out the drip tray. I've run some white vinegar through it twice in that many years to remove lime deposits. I keep it on 24/7, but it's programmable for time on/off if you like.

I was a little put off that it didn't come with a carafe but I still had one from my last machine.  No big deal.  I ran through the set up instructions just as I did for all of my previous machines.  The smell and taste of plastic is overwhelming.  Now that I see other reviews stating the same I think it's irresponsible to continue selling this.  I've tried everything from repeatedly cleaning and descaling the machine to running all of the samples and more to get rid of the plastic smell and taste.  Nothing worked.

This is a full sized coffee maker and a cup as I've described (think Tervis or Klean Kanteen) should fit.

The pictures show the carafe and text talks about a carafe and mug size pods, but it never mentions that the carafe is not included with this model.  My previous k-cup coffee maker was a Cuisinart model SS700, so I'm spoiled as to how one of these should work.  This model makes considerably more pump noise and it delivers the coffee in pulsed, spurt-like streams rather than in a continuous quiet stream like the Cuisinart would.  It takes a few days to get used to it.  The energy saving mode means that it has to heat the water before it will dispense, so you have to wait a couple more minutes in the morning after waking it up for it to be ready to make coffee.  It does a very good job of making coffee.  Unlike my SS700, it actually dispenses an 8 or 10 oz cup and the option to make it stronger is very useful.  My only complaint has to do with the cup support tray.  It does not connect solidly to the coffee maker and slides out of position quite easily.  If you also want the carafe and some K-carafe pods, you should purchase model K550 or K560, both of which often sell for less than the K575.  Go figure...",Coffee maker and filter only.

If my kid made a product this bad, they would be grounded for a year. I bought this to replace an older Keurig. I do not recommend, the new Keurig systems are horrible, this was the third system I have tried in the past three months (K55, 425s and this). They start including a self cleaning tool because they clog up so much. Any medal items they have replace with cheap plastic and the whole system seems flimsy. If you are wanting to try a Keurig system, wait until a new line comes out. There were great features on this machine. I am not a coffee drinker (My spouse is) and the coffee features work great, until it clogs up. It clogs up about every fourth cup. I called support a couple of times and they tell you to use the cleaning tool and run hot water. It takes about 18oz of hot water to clear the system out before restarting it, you have to do it after every fourth cup of coffee. I like using the hot water for tea and oatmeal, but you have to have at least 18 oz of water filtered first. This is a picture of the Keurig with 10 oz of water run through it. The old system was so much better. If I could go back in time and purchase two or three of those systems I would. If you have trying to buy a new Keurig.

Bryan C.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFHMOOMADFBFZQW6RNJY6XAIUFQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"I am reviewing the Keurig 2.0 Model K575 coffee brewing system. Before I begin, I just want to say in advance, "" Thanks, Keurig and Influenster, I received this free product for my unbiased review. My wife and I really love this machine and the single cup concept.  I did no know anything about the 2.0 system, Naturally not knowing anything about the 2.0, I began to research it and read the reviews. To be quite honest, I was initially very upset that I was supposedly getting an ""upgraded"" machine in which my K -cups I had might not work. I was reading reviews and feeling the same as all of those frustrated with this news UNTIL I realized that there are VERY FEW K Cups that may not work in this machine. I realized that all the bad reviews were coming from people who buy the cheap off-brand or no-name version of a K-cup that some stores sell to use in this machine to try and save money. I don't blame Keurig one bit for trying to keep others from riding on their coat tails by trying to make money off of someone else's hard work. I have no connection with Keurig. To be honest with you, I'm not in the business world at all. I'm a firefighter who happens to like a good cup of coffee from a company with quality customer service. The new Keurig 2.0 is a great machine despite all the bad ratings it gets. The bad reviews are only based on the customers anger which should not be used to rate the quality and function of this machine. It brews a great cup of coffee or you can even brew a carafe for a larger group. Every K -cup we own works in this system. It has a larger water reservoir, so it doesn't have to be filled as often. It also has a touch screen with more choices in the size of the cup of coffee you may want. Don't let the reviews about the K-cups sway your decision about purchasing this unit. It's a great coffee Machine.

First of all, we have a ""whole house"" water filtering system which we love. I would think it would be great for a coffee maker, but now Keurig is telling me all my problems are because of our filtering system. I was told to use spring water in it and it seems to work (well, 3 cups so far), but that 3 more than I got with our filtered water. I find it hard to believe I am going to have to start buying water after already spending the money for a really nice filter system. And, another REALLY big thing I don't like is that my coffee mugs I had been using with my previous system won't work with this one.

It's considerably louder than my old generation platinum brewer that gave up after 7 yrs.  The noise sounds more like it is giving birth rather than brewing coffee.  I'm giving it 3 stars because of what I consider very misleading information.  Of all the new brewers only this model notes ""on demand hot water"" so I foolishly thought that meant hot water that is not going through the same path as coffee.  Any real tea drinker HATES coffee flavored water in their tea.  So a separate hot water channel would be a bonus with a brewer like this.  So I contacted Keurig to confirm that the on demand hot water is separate and it is not.  The response was if you are getting coffee flavor in your tea then perhaps run a few plain water brews before getting hot water for making tea.

To be honest, I didn't care too much about the options as I don't drink more than 12 oz. of coffee. However, that should have been clue that this Keurig was a dud.  In June 2016, the Low Pressure notice came up. I cleaned it per manual. Worked fine, but a week later the Low Pressure came up again.  Fast forward, it is now Feb. 2018, it makes 1 cup a week without the Low Pressure message.  When I do get a cup, its saturated with coffee grinds.  For the price, the poor customer service, and low quality of Keurig, I am currently looking for other brands on Amazon.

We have had nothing but problems with this model.  The main issue is that it is very sensitive to any variation in K-cups.  We have used multiple different K-cups from various vendors.  This unit works sometimes and other times if bursts the membrane and spills coffee grounds in the cup and throughout the machine requiring thorough cleaning.  We have also experienced multiple times that the machine had to be cleaned.  We had a Cuisinart before this one that I took to my work location.  The Cuisinart is still working fine.  We have never had a problem with it.  Using the same K-cups that exploded in the Keurig have had no problems in the Cuisinart.  I would strongly recommend that you avoid this machine.  It is far too sensitive and unreliable.

I find it hard to believe this passed the marketing department as well as the customer review/trials prior to releasing it to retail stores. My first week, I couldn't make coffee one morning till I cleaned the needle. Try reading instructions at 0520. I jack with the thing for 5 minutes, 2 was just trying to make my eyes focus on the micro print instructions. I finally gave up and unplugged it to reset. Every week it would have to do this and sometimes, 3 times in a morning - just turn it off/on and it resets. At times, it doesn't puncture the pod, so it stops till you reset again. It will not read some coffee pods, so buy their brand or suck it up buttercup, no soup for you! The pump makes a lot of noise and it makes you select the cup serving size every time you switch flavors.  I have 3 of these boat anchors. 2 at work and 1 at home and I can tell you, its a over priced piece of junk.

However, a few things I don't like about it. Maybe it's due to the various dispensing sizes, but it seems to take much longer to heat up than my previous Keurig (which only offered a couple sizes). So, when filling a coffee mug, there is a bit of a wait (too long, if you ask me) between the first filling, the unit ""processing"" (heating additional water), and the next filling. The other issue is that the clock began blinking one day for no apparent reason. When I was finally forced to phone Keurig's customer support, I was told that the screen can be ""a little buggy"" when left the coffeemaker is left fully on 24-7. So, they advised that I turn the unit off, if I'm not going to use it for a number of hours. I call this a ""workaround"" for a problem design. Again, once I turn it on, I must wait for it to heat up. I'd probably buy this Keurig again because these problems are not ""show stoppers.""

I've owned two other brewers when I decided to upgrade. It is July of 2016 as I write this, come on people, does the fact that you have to buy a coffee they have rights to THAT big of a deal? Really? I found that there are ample coffees out there for all budgets that will work, so, where's the issue? Not what your ""regular"" coffee is? Guess what, welcome to life and change happens. Many said that it was Keurig's greed, why? They paid for the rights, they haven't put a gun to your head and told you to buy their brewer! You CHOSE it without I can only guess, reading the information on it. Yes, I read about the brewer PRIOR to purchase, ignorance is NEVER an excuse. I have had the brewer for a month now, no problems at all, has larger cup options, the carafe is great, and with K-mugs now, you can brew a full travel mug. Bottom line, when you buy something, READ THE DETAILS, it's not Keurig's fault that you were lazy. For people who like a good product, ease of use, and so many options, this is for you. If you're worried about spending an extra buck or two on coffee? I think you can still get a drip coffee pot for around 12 bucks at Wal Mart.",Stop whining!
