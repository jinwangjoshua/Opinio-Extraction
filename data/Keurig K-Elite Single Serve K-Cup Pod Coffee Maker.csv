Have used it for water-only as well. Convenient to use and glad the size of the machine is now slightly shorter than recent models but wish it was still slightly shorter to fit better under my cabinets without having to pull it forward; bought an organizer for pods on wheels with a brake to assist with this and the machine sits on top of this. Also wish the display was angled toward the user since I am short and cannot see it and it is up high on the kitchen counter (it is angled toward the ceiling on this model). Brews without leaving grounds and hot water seems hot enough on highest setting. Can use any generic pod with this machine. Heats up very quickly and brews in less than a minute. The only noise is at the very end of the cycle when it starts to ""spit"" for a little for a few seconds but no residual drips.

We had a K575 and it was a nightmare because of the DRM issue not letting us use pods from our favorite non-Keurig companies. We felt bamboozled by the whole Keurig 2.0 thing and wanted to make sure we had a machine that was the latest when we bought the K575...and turned out it was the worst thing to do.  After throwing away so many pods for no good reason because of the ""oops error message"" we learned how to fool it, but even that didn't always work, and sometimes even Keurig proprietary pods got the error message. Shame on Keurig!  So we dismembered and thew out the other machine with a vengeance...so it could never bring pain to anyone again...and ordered this K-Elite. It's got the best features of all machines, and uses any of the pods we've put in so far. It makes a great cup of Joe, FAST. It also doesn't have the goofy display to scroll through, but still has a ""strong"" setting and clock, with plenty of brew size options.

I thought that it would brew at a different temperature, but it's identical to any other kind of brew process. You can do this with any keurig - you just fill a cup with ice, the ""iced coffee or tea"" brews hot and then is cooled down by the ice. What the iced button does it make it a ""small"" so that it fits in a cup with ice. However you do not need to spend any extra money on this feature and I am quite disappointed in Keurig for marketing it this way. The iced button is misleading, the marketing is misleading and that doesn't make me feel very good about my purchase.

Interestingly enough the one I gave as a gift had the exact same problem.  Amazon is replacing both coffee makers.  Keurig indicated it seems to be the needle where you insert the Kcups that is the problem.  Great price but wondered if the coffee makers on Prime Day were all rejects even though the box showed not to have been opened and were sold as new.  Disappointing.  Update.

Kll799,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE4I4MNFZ43RH4CS7YWJIXCBNDGQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pdp?ie=UTF8,"I have now had four different Keurig models over the years.... and I haven t been overly dissapointed with the coffee. Granted, a k-cup coffee is never going to taste the same as an actual ground bean brewed cup....but....it has always been a good stand in. That being said, I really don t see any great changes to the actual coffee brewing features. There is the classic option to  strong  brew your coffee - although it never really seems any stronger to me.... The appearance of this machine is a bit different. The display area is at the top of the machine - which does make this a challenging brewer if you are planning to place it under a countertop. You must really open the top lever to insert the k cup and the controls are all on the top- if not purely for countertop use....this is a tough machine to use when placed on a counter under a cabinet. The main feature that really bugs me about this unit.....the digital functions. With today s technology, and the cost of this item...I would at least expect a touch screen or increased button option. The frustration of having to hit the same buttons multiple times to get the features you want - or set up features....it reminds me of an old digital alarm clock....when you accidentally scroll past your alarm time and have to cycle through the whole am/pm to get back to the start. The brushed steel look is an attractive feature and wipes off well. Overall, this machine does seem a lot more dense and heavy than the others... the setup instructions are somewhat frustrating. Upon opening, I really just wanted a cup of coffee....not to have to scroll through endless digital menus in order to actual use all of the features.

This ""K-Elite"" replaces a B60 Special Edition that was still working after almost 8 years of usage. The only reason I bought the K-Elite is I couldn't pass up the Prime Day deal and decided that we would shelve the B60 as a backup. We really like this new machine compared to the old one...1) ever so slightly shorter which helps with cabinets with bottom molding (our B60 had to be shoved in further as to not hit molding with the pod handle), 2) MUCH quieter than the B60 ""Quiet Brew"", the B60 would sound like it was taking off from the airport, 3) a couple of more cup size options, 4) larger water tank means less weekly fill ups, 5) a nicer display and a nice light for water tank which does surprisingly help you see level at 4am, 6) strong brew actually works!! (for those of us who want a nice wake up cup). About the only thing I can complain about is the design of the water tank. If you look quickly at the rear of the tank and use that as your top off guide you will have water all over the counter as I did the first time filling this. The FRONT of the tank is the limiting factor as it sits almost an inch lower than the back. Not a deal breaker by any stretch, and I won't deduct any stars for it, just something to be aware of and pass the word around to other household members. Not completely sure what the ""hot water"" function does...well, I know what it does, but I used to just run the B60 without a k-cup for that. Haven't tried the iced coffee setting, I'm not a fan, but the wife is. If it works well then it's just another feather in the cap of this brewer. All in all, completely satisfied and regard this as a great upgrade to the B60 Special Edition. Time will tell if it has the longevity that the B60 had.

One reviewer said he had it a year? It's only been out since Feb 2018. Just to be clear, I am reviewing the 2018 Keurig K-Elite brushed slate. My first Keurig was the K-Classic, and it lasted a whopping 6 years without a single problem! The following year it started leaking just a bit from the base about once a week or so. Still kept it, as it worked perfectly. I started looking for another Keurig, and saw a commercial for the K-Select. Looked nice on TV, so I went to the store to check it out. Well, it was not made nearly as sturdy as the Classic model I had. I thought it was very flimsy, and cheap looking. So on the shelf it stayed! I actually ended up buying a Nespresso Pixie, which makes great espresso, but not good if you want a nice hot cup of coffee! I kept checking Keurig off and on, to see if they came out with anything new. BINGO! The K-Elite! This is hands down the BEST Keurig yet! What I like, It's quiet, fast, simple to use, many cup sizes, dispenses a full cup of water without having to hold the button (unlike the bulky, ugly K575 we have at the office), the handle and metal plate are both of matte metal, and the plate is nice and thick, the handle opens smoothly, the lid comes off in one piece, it's beautifully finished, and best of all....I've been using it almost six months, and NOT one single ground is in the pod! I don't know how they accomplished that, as that was an issue with all previous Keurig's, but this machine stays clean!

I have used the mini K-15 while visiting and felt as a coffee lover, it is a waste of time. I have personally owned 3-Keurig Classic K 55 coffee makers and have used them hard over the last 18 years. My last maker bought the dust after 5 years of hard use! I purchased the new K-Elite 75 oz  water reservoir and have been using about 1 month now.  It brews a great cup of coffee and actually adds a little froth at the end of brewing if you like expresso. I enjoy the hot water button that works great for instant cereal or cup of soups etc... It also has 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 oz brew sizes. I use the iced coffee and the strong buttons to brew a great cup of iced coffee. My travel mug fits easily under the drip mechanism. All K-cup shaped pods work. If you use your own ground coffee you need to buy the my-K cup pod for a nominal price. The quick start directions allowed me to enjoy a fresh cup within 30 minutes upon arrival.  The ""on"" timer does not always work unless reset, but pushing a button and having coffee in 2 minutes is okay with me!

So, I order this pot and some Folgers. I get the pot and run water through it just in case there is that ""plastic"" taste that other have warned about. Oh, I should mention that the reserve on this pot is 72 ounces... OVER a half a gallon, so I don't have to fill it up all the time. Anyway, I drink a 12 ounce cup, so I make one, and it is PERFECT for me! My husband drinks a 16 ounce cup, so I run two 8 ounce ones, some may think that is too much work, but he doesn't like his coffee as strong as I do, so I run the second one without a K-Cup, and he has a perfect cup of coffee too.

It looks nice on the counter and it has worked fine - although I've only used it occasionally - during the last few months. It's basically like every other Keurig I've tried before since they seem to be in every doctor's and dentist's office these days. This particular model does have the added features of higher water temperatures and a stronger brew. Despite these new upgrades, however, I still find the final product that streams into my cup sorely lacking. I have yet to have a really good cup of coffee or tea from this or any Keurig. Perhaps it's user error. Perhaps it's just my preference for a strong, super hot cuppa. If I want really good cup of coffee I use my Frigidaire drip maker and if I want a really good cup of tea I boil water and grab a bag of Irish Breakfast leaves.
